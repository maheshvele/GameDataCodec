In my opinion, when we use 10 bits to represent each vertex, we would strike a good balance with minimal RMS value and file size 

The RMS value at 10 bits is a good tradeoff when compared to using 5 bits because the error is greatly reduced also,
when compared to the filesize of the 16 bits bitStream data, it is much smaller.
